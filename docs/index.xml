<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-holiday-dive-into-combinatorics">A Holiday Dive into Combinatorics</h2>
<p>With a bit of free time on my hands during the holiday break, I decided to embark on a mathematical adventure into the foundations of combinatorial algorithms. And what better companion for this journey than the classic text, A Walk Through Combinatorics and Graph Theory by Miklós Bóna?</p>
<p>I’ve made my way through the first few chapters, and in this post, I’ll share my take on them—presented with a twist. While the book itself is excellent, it can sometimes lean toward the formal side, making the underlying intuition a bit elusive. Nevertheless, its clear structure and step-by-step introduction of concepts make it a fantastic resource for beginners.</p>
<p>So, if you’re ready to explore the world of combinatorics from a fresh perspective, join me on this walk! I hope you enjoy the journey as much as I did. 😊</p>

<section id="how-many-ways-can-mathematicians-line-up-for-coffee" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-many-ways-can-mathematicians-line-up-for-coffee">How Many Ways Can Mathematicians Line Up for Coffee?</h2>
<p>Let us commence our mathematical adventure with a deceptively simple question: Given <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> individuals, in how many distinct ways can we arrange them in a single line? Imagine, if you will, a group of eager volunteers—perhaps mathematicians at a conference—awaiting their turn to stand in line for coffee.</p>
<p>For the coveted first spot in the line, we have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> enthusiastic candidates. Once that position is filled, only <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n-1"> hopefuls remain for the second spot, as one lucky individual is already sipping their metaphorical coffee at the front. This process continues, with each subsequent spot having one fewer option, until the final position, which is reserved for the last remaining person (who, let’s be honest, probably didn’t want to stand in line anyway).</p>
<p>Multiplying these choices together, we obtain the grand total of possible arrangements:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20n%20%5Ctimes%20(n-1)%20%5Ctimes%20(n-2)%20%5Ctimes%20%5Ccdots%20%5Ctimes%202%20%5Ctimes%201%20"></p>
<p>This mathematical mouthful is succinctly denoted as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n!"> (read as “n factorial”). In other words, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n!"> is the number of ways to organize <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> unique individuals into a line—no coffee required, but a dash of combinatorial curiosity is highly recommended!</p>
<p>By convention, we define <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0!%20=%201">. At first glance, this might seem as peculiar as decaf coffee at a mathematicians’ conference, but let’s explore why this makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Imagine we have two coffee machines. In front of the first machine, there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> mathematicians eagerly awaiting their caffeine fix, while <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> mathematicians queue up at the second machine. The question arises: in how many ways can we form two separate lines, one for each machine? The answer is straightforward—there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n!"> possible arrangements for the first line and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m!"> for the second, so the total number of ways to organize both lines is:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20n!%20%5Ctimes%20m!%20"></p>
<p>Now, let’s introduce a plot twist. Suppose all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> mathematicians at the second coffee machine suddenly decide to abandon their quest for coffee and leave the line. The second line is now empty, but our original question remains: in how many ways can we form two lines? For the first machine, we still have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n!"> possible arrangements. For the second, with zero mathematicians, how many ways can we arrange an empty line? By our earlier formula, the answer must be:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20n!%20%5Ctimes%200!%20"></p>
<p>But logically, there is exactly one way to arrange nothing at all—by doing nothing! Thus, for our formula to remain consistent, we must have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0!%20=%201">. It’s a mathematical nod to the power of nothingness: even an empty line counts as one arrangement!</p>

<section id="from-lineups-to-teams-counting-unique-combinations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-lineups-to-teams-counting-unique-combinations">From Lineups to Teams: Counting Unique Combinations</h2>
<p>Now, let’s up the ante: suppose we wish to divide our <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> mathematicians into <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> disjoint teams. The first team will have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_1"> members, the second team <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_2"> members, and so on, until the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-th team, which has <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_t"> members. Since no mathematician is allowed to clone themselves (yet), each person can only be in one team, so we must have:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20a_1%20+%20a_2%20+%20%5Ccdots%20+%20a_t%20=%20n%20"></p>
<p>A natural question arises: in how many ways can we organize our <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> mathematicians into these <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> teams?</p>
<p>One intuitive approach is to line up all the mathematicians in some order and then assign the first <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_1"> people to the first team, the next <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_2"> to the second team, and so on. Since there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n!"> ways to arrange <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> people in a line, it might be tempting to declare that there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n!"> ways to form the teams.</p>
<p>However, there’s a subtle catch: within each team, the order of the members doesn’t matter. The team consisting of Alice, Bob, and Eve is indistinguishable from the team of Bob, Eve, and Alice—unless, of course, you’re keeping score of who gets their coffee first.</p>
<p>This means that our <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n!"> possible lineups will generate many duplicate team configurations. Why? Because within each team, the order of the members doesn’t matter. For example, if the first team has <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_1"> members, any of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_1!"> ways to arrange those people among themselves will result in the exact same team. The same logic applies to the second team: there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_2!"> ways to rearrange its members without changing the team itself. This continues for each team, all the way up to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-th team, which can be internally rearranged in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_t!"> ways.</p>
<p>To find the total number of duplicate arrangements, we multiply these possibilities together:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20a_1!%20%5Ctimes%20a_2!%20%5Ctimes%20%5Ccdots%20%5Ctimes%20a_t!%20"></p>
<p>This product represents all the ways we can shuffle the members within each team, across all teams, without actually creating a new team configuration. So, to count only the truly distinct ways to form the teams, we divide the total number of lineups, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n!">, by this product:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20%5Cfrac%7Bn!%7D%7Ba_1!%20%5Ctimes%20a_2!%20%5Ctimes%20%5Ccdots%20%5Ctimes%20a_t!%7D%20"></p>
<p>In other words, we’re correcting for all the “internal shuffling” that doesn’t change the teams themselves.</p>

<section id="choosing-subsets-when-order-doesnt-matter" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="choosing-subsets-when-order-doesnt-matter">Choosing Subsets: When Order Doesn’t Matter</h2>
<p>Now, let’s zoom in on a particularly famous case of our team-forming formula: the binomial coefficient. Some of you may already feel a sense of déjà vu!</p>
<p>Suppose we set the number of teams to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20=%202">, and let the first team have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> members (that is, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_1%20=%20k">). By necessity, the second team will have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20-%20k"> members, since <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_2%20=%20n%20-%20k">. Plugging these values into our earlier formula, we get:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20%5Cfrac%7Bn!%7D%7Bk!%20(n-k)!%7D%20"></p>
<p>This expression is known as the binomial coefficient, and is commonly denoted as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbinom%7Bn%7D%7Bk%7D">. It represents the number of ways to choose a subset of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> individuals from a set of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">—or, in less formal terms, the number of ways to assemble a team of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> mathematicians from a larger group of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">.</p>
<p>But why do we call this a “set”? Because, in a set, the order of the elements doesn’t matter—just as in our team-forming scenario above. Whether Alice, Bob, and Eve are chosen in that order or in any other, it’s the same team. So, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbinom%7Bn%7D%7Bk%7D"> counts the number of unordered groups of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> people you can select from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> candidates—a mathematical staple as classic as coffee at a conference!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-binomial-theorem-vowels-and-the-magic-of-counting-twice">The Binomial Theorem, Vowels, and the Magic of Counting Twice</h2>
<p>Now, for my favorite part of this post: story proofs! Throughout our mathematical education—whether in high school, undergrad, or even grad school—we’re often presented with proofs that are formal, symbol-heavy, and, let’s be honest, sometimes a bit intimidating. But here’s the secret: you don’t always need a blizzard of symbols to make a proof rigorous. Sometimes, a good story is all you need.</p>
<p>This idea is beautifully championed by Prof.&nbsp;Joe Blitzstein in his legendary Stat 110 course at Harvard. Instead of drowning in algebraic notation, let’s prove a classic result with a story. Consider the famous Binomial Theorem:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20(x%20+%20y)%5En%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bk=0%7D%5En%20%5Cbinom%7Bn%7D%7Bk%7D%20x%5Ek%20y%5E%7Bn-k%7D%20"></p>
<p>Don’t ask me for a “standard” proof—I’m not sure I know one! But I can offer a proof that’s intuitive, makes perfect sense, and is as solid as any formal argument.</p>
<p>The Story:</p>
<p>Suppose you have a vocabulary of size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v">. How many <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-letter words can you form using this vocabulary? For each letter in the word, you have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> choices, so the total number of possible words is simply <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v%5En">.</p>
<p>Now, let’s count the same thing in a more nuanced way. Suppose your vocabulary consists of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> vowels and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> consonants, so <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%20+%20y%20=%20v">. Let’s ask: how many <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-letter words have exactly <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> vowels, and those vowels are placed at specific positions <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i_1,%20i_2,%20%5Cldots,%20i_k">?</p>
<p>For each of these <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> positions, you have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> choices (any vowel), so there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5Ek"> ways to assign vowels to those spots. For the remaining <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n-k"> positions, each can be filled with any of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> consonants, giving <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y%5E%7Bn-k%7D"> possibilities. So, for a fixed set of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> positions for the vowels, there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5Ek%20y%5E%7Bn-k%7D"> possible words.</p>
<p>But how many ways can we choose which <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> positions will be occupied by vowels? That’s exactly <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbinom%7Bn%7D%7Bk%7D">, the number of ways to choose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> positions out of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">.</p>
<p>Therefore, the total number of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-letter words with exactly <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> vowels (regardless of where they appear) is:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20%5Cbinom%7Bn%7D%7Bk%7D%20x%5Ek%20y%5E%7Bn-k%7D%20"></p>
<p>To find the total number of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-letter words (with any number of vowels from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">), we sum over all possible values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k">:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20%5Csum_%7Bk=0%7D%5En%20%5Cbinom%7Bn%7D%7Bk%7D%20x%5Ek%20y%5E%7Bn-k%7D%20"></p>
<p>But we already know, from our earlier calculation, that the total number of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-letter words is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v%5En">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v%20=%20x%20+%20y">. So, by counting the same thing in two different ways, we arrive at:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20(x%20+%20y)%5En%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bk=0%7D%5En%20%5Cbinom%7Bn%7D%7Bk%7D%20x%5Ek%20y%5E%7Bn-k%7D%20"></p>
<p>And there you have it—a proof that’s as satisfying as finding the last piece of a mathematical puzzle, all thanks to a story about vowels, consonants, and the magic of counting!</p>

  <title>A Shred of Light on the Smoothing Parameter in Lattices</title>
  <dc:creator>Mihail Plesa</dc:creator>
  <link>https://miiip.github.io/posts/Gaussian.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>If you’ve delved into lattice-based cryptography, you’ve probably encountered the intriguing concept of the smoothing parameter. In this post, we’ll break it down step by step, “reverse engineering” this essential lattice parameter. The aim? To help you develop a clear and intuitive understanding of it—rooted in solid mathematical principles (and maybe a touch of fun)! 😊</p>
<p>One of the standout features of lattice-based cryptography is its robust worst-case to average-case reduction security proof. Here’s the essence: when we set up a lattice-based cryptosystem, elements like secret keys and noise are generated randomly. If we assume an attacker cannot solve the underlying mathematical problem for a random instance, the system is said to have average-case security. But lattice-based cryptography takes this a step further. It provides rigorous proofs showing that solving a random (average-case) instance of certain lattice problems is at least as hard as solving the worst-case instance of a related problem. In simpler terms, if an attacker can break a random instance, they can also crack the hardest instances. This foundational property greatly boosts our confidence in the security of lattice-based cryptography.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the big picture: many security proofs in the lattice world rely on the following structure:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Choose a lattice point.<br>
</li>
<li>Randomly generate a noise vector.<br>
</li>
<li>Add the noise to the lattice point and reduce the result modulo the fundamental domain.</li>
</ol>
<p>To make this more concrete, consider an example in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E2">. Here, the chosen lattice point is represented by the green point, the noise by the red vector, the sum of the two by the blue point, and the reduction modulo the fundamental domain (the hashed area) by the ‘x’ point.</p>
<p>For clarity and completeness, let’s introduce some notations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> represents the lattice.<br>
</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7Bn%20%5Ctimes%20n%7D"> is the basis of the lattice <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L">.<br>
</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D(B)"> denotes the fundamental domain of the lattice.</li>
</ol>
<p>This structure forms the foundation for understanding key concepts in lattice-based cryptography.</p>

<h1>The problem</h1>
<p>Now, let’s introduce some constraints:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We want the expected norm of the error vector to be a specific value, denoted as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">.<br>
</li>
<li>As with most things in cryptography, we want the result of the reduction to appear as if it were sampled from a uniform distribution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why do we need these properties? Well, that’s a story for another article! 😊</p>
<p>At first glance, one might think: “If we want vectors that look uniformly distributed, why not just sample each coordinate from a uniform distribution?” While this approach works perfectly for the second property, it fails to satisfy the first. Sampling each coordinate uniformly results in vectors with norms that deviate significantly from the desired value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">.</p>
<p>To focus on the first property, one solution is to sample each coordinate from a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s%20/%20%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> is the number of coordinates. This ensures the expected norm of the vector is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">. But what about the “uniform-like” appearance?</p>
<p>Let’s build some intuition. A lattice has a clear periodic structure. Looking at the earlier example, we see the fundamental domain (a single cell) repeating endlessly to cover the entire space. This means any point in space can be expressed as the sum of a point in the fundamental domain and a lattice point.</p>
<p>From another perspective, if we repeatedly translate the fundamental domain by lattice points, we cover the entire space. Thus, every point can be uniquely written as the sum of a lattice point and a point within the fundamental domain. This is illustrated in the figure below and can be expressed formally as:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20w%20=%20t%20+%20v,%20%5Ctext%7B%20for%20a%20unique%20%7D%20t%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D(B)%20%5Ctext%7B%20and%20a%20unique%20%7D%20v%20%5Cin%20L.%20"></p>
<p>This decomposition is key to understanding how we achieve both properties simultaneously.</p>

<h1>Gaussian reduction</h1>
<p>This equivalence relation naturally emerges: two points are considered equivalent if they map to the same point in the fundamental domain. In other words, two points are equivalent if they differ by a lattice vector.</p>
<p>Now, let’s revisit the Gaussian distribution, denoted by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D_s">, which describes the probability distribution of vectors with an expected norm <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">. For each point <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D_s"> assigns a probability density value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D_s(x)">.</p>
<p>This leads to an intriguing question:</p>
<p><strong>How does the Gaussian distribution behave under the equivalence relation?</strong><br>
<strong>What is the density value assigned to a point in the fundamental domain?</strong></p>
<p>Recall that for every point <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D(B)"> (the fundamental domain), there are infinitely many equivalent points in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En"> that differ by lattice vectors. For instance, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D_s"> assigns a density value to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> and another density value to each equivalent point <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w%20=%20t%20+%20v">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> is any lattice vector. However, under the equivalence relation, all these points <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w"> are treated as “the same” as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">. So, how do we assign a single density value to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">?</p>
<p>A natural solution is to define a new probability distribution, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s">, restricted to the fundamental domain. The density value assigned by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> to a point <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D(B)"> is the sum of all density values assigned by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D_s"> to its equivalent points <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w%20=%20t%20+%20v">, for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v%20%5Cin%20L">. Formally, this is written as:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s(x)%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bz%20%5Cin%20L%7D%20%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D_s(x%20+%20z)%20"></p>
<p>This construction ensures that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> respects the equivalence relation and is properly defined over the fundamental domain.</p>
<p>Let’s take another look at our goal. We want to sample an error vector from a Gaussian distribution with an expected norm of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">. However, after reducing this error to the fundamental domain, it should appear as though it was sampled from a uniform distribution. In other words, while the error is initially drawn from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D_s">, we want the resulting distribution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> to be indistinguishable from a uniform distribution.</p>
<p>To build intuition, let’s consider a simple lattice, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D">, with the fundamental domain <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B0,%201)">. We’ll explore how <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> behaves for different values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">. For small values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> (e.g., <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.2">), <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> is far from uniform—it has noticeable peaks and valleys, unlike the flat line of a uniform distribution. But as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> increases, something fascinating happens: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> starts to flatten out, gradually resembling a uniform distribution. For sufficiently large <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> becomes nearly indistinguishable from uniform.</p>
<p>This behavior is key to achieving both properties: maintaining the expected norm of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> while ensuring the reduced error appears uniform.</p>

<p>To summarize the big picture: our goal is to sample error vectors from a Gaussian distribution to achieve an expected norm of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">, while ensuring that the error appears uniformly distributed when reduced modulo the fundamental domain. The intuitive way to meet both requirements is to make the Gaussian distribution sufficiently wide.</p>
<p>This makes sense intuitively: a Gaussian distribution is defined by its characteristic “hump.” When the distribution is wide enough and mapped into a small cell (the fundamental domain), the “hump” effect diminishes, producing a distribution that closely resembles uniformity.</p>
<p>Now, we still have one crucial question to address: how “wide” does the Gaussian distribution need to be for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> to appear uniform? To answer this, we need a way to measure how “uniform” <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> actually is. Here’s a hint: let’s visualize <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> by plotting it over the entire space. This will give us valuable insights into its behavior and help us determine the required “width.”</p>

<h1>Fourier</h1>
<p>It looks a lot like a periodic function, doesn’t it? This observation doesn’t change what we’ve noted about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">: as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> increases, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> becomes increasingly uniform.</p>
<p>This periodicity naturally leads us to think about Fourier analysis.</p>
<p>Consider a “nice” periodic function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f:%20%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D(B)%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D">. Why <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D(B)"> and not <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En">? Well, since the function is periodic over the lattice, it’s sufficient to define it over a single lattice cell (the fundamental domain). Fourier transform allows us to express <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> as a sum of periodic basis functions of the form <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%20%5Cmapsto%20e%5E%7B2%5Cpi%20i%20%5Clangle%20x,%20y%20%5Crangle%7D">.</p>
<p>Let’s visualize some of these basis functions—or at least the real part of them—to build intuition!</p>

<p>We’ve plotted some basis functions for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y%20=%201">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y%20=%202">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y%20=%204">, but why not try <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y%20=%20%5Csqrt%7B2%7D"> or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y%20=%201.5">? What determines the allowed values for the frequencies? The answer lies in the periodicity of the basis functions:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20e%5E%7B2%5Cpi%20i%20%5Clangle%20x,%20y%20%5Crangle%7D%20=%20e%5E%7B2%5Cpi%20i%20%5Clangle%20x+v,%20y%20%5Crangle%7D,%20%5Cquad%20%5Ctext%7Bfor%20all%20%7D%20v%20%5Cin%20L.%20"></p>
<p>Expanding this, we get:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20e%5E%7B2%5Cpi%20i%20%5Clangle%20x+v,%20y%20%5Crangle%7D%20=%20e%5E%7B2%5Cpi%20i%20%5Clangle%20x,%20y%20%5Crangle%7D%20e%5E%7B2%5Cpi%20i%20%5Clangle%20v,%20y%20%5Crangle%7D,%20"></p>
<p>which implies:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20e%5E%7B2%5Cpi%20i%20%5Clangle%20v,%20y%20%5Crangle%7D%20=%201.%20"></p>
<p>This condition holds when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2%5Cpi%20i%20%5Clangle%20v,%20y%20%5Crangle%20=%200">, or equivalently, when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clangle%20v,%20y%20%5Crangle%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v%20%5Cin%20L">.</p>
<p>In other words, the allowed frequencies are vectors <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En"> such that their dot product with every point in the lattice <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> is an integer. Interestingly, these frequencies themselves form a lattice, called the <strong>dual lattice</strong>, denoted by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%5E*">.</p>
<p>Let’s return to our function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f">, which can be expressed as:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20f(x)%20=%20%5Csum_%7By%20%5Cin%20L%5E*%7D%20%5Chat%7Bf%7D(y)%20e%5E%7B2%5Cpi%20i%20%5Clangle%20x,%20y%20%5Crangle%7D,%20"></p>
<p>where the Fourier coefficients <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7Bf%7D(y)"> are given by:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20%5Chat%7Bf%7D(y)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cdet(L)%7D%20%5Cint_%7B%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D(B)%7D%20f(x)%20e%5E%7B-2%5Cpi%20i%20%5Clangle%20x,%20y%20%5Crangle%7D%20%5C,%20dx.%20"></p>
<p>Here, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7Bf%7D(y)"> represents the “weight” of the basis function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e%5E%7B2%5Cpi%20i%20%5Clangle%20x,%20y%20%5Crangle%7D"> in the decomposition. While this may seem abstract, in our case, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> is simply the Gaussian distribution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s(x)">, which represents the reduced Gaussian over the fundamental domain. For this specific function, the Fourier coefficients are straightforward to compute. Ignoring the constant <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdet(L)"> for simplicity, we have:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20%5Chat%7B%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D%7D_s(y)%20=%20e%5E%7B-%5Cpi%20s%5E2%20%7Cy%7C%5E2%7D.%20"></p>
<p>Why does this matter? Our goal is to measure how “uniform” <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> is. Intuitively, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> were perfectly uniform, its Fourier transform would have only one non-zero coefficient at <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y%20=%200">, with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D%7D_s(0)%20=%201">. All other coefficients would be zero, as a uniform distribution requires no additional frequencies to describe it.</p>
<p>In general, we can define a “uniformity metric” for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> by summing the Fourier coefficients for all non-zero frequencies. The smaller this sum, the closer <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> is to uniform. This metric is expressed as:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20%5Crho_%7B1/s%7D(L%5E*%20%5Csetminus%20%5C%7B0%5C%7D)%20=%20%5Csum_%7By%20%5Cin%20L%5E*%20%5Csetminus%20%5C%7B0%5C%7D%7D%20e%5E%7B-%5Cpi%20%7Cy%7C%5E2%20s%5E2%7D.%20"></p>
<p>This notation aligns with standard conventions, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crho"> represents the Gaussian mass. The goal in applications is to ensure that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> is sufficiently uniform by keeping this metric below a chosen threshold <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon">:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20%5Crho_%7B1/s%7D(L%5E*%20%5Csetminus%20%5C%7B0%5C%7D)%20%3C%20%5Cepsilon.%20"></p>
<p>While perfect uniformity is unattainable, this approach provides a practical and rigorous way to ensure <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s"> is “uniform enough” for cryptographic security.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusions" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>Let’s circle back to our motivation: we aimed to sample an error vector with a specific norm that appears uniformly distributed when reduced modulo the fundamental domain. The solution? Sample the vector from a Gaussian distribution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D_s"> and reduce it to the fundamental domain. We observed that as the standard deviation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> increases, the reduced distribution becomes more uniform. To measure this uniformity, we introduced the metric <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crho_%7B1/s%7D(L%5E*%20%5Csetminus%20%5C%7B0%5C%7D)">.</p>
<p>Now, for the final piece: the <strong>smoothing parameter</strong> of a lattice, denoted by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ceta_%7B%5Cepsilon%7D(L)">, is defined as the smallest <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> such that:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20%5Crho_%7B1/s%7D(L%5E*%20%5Csetminus%20%5C%7B0%5C%7D)%20%3C%20%5Cepsilon.%20"></p>
<p>In this article, we’ve developed some intuition around the smoothing parameter. But the real magic lies in how Regev used this concept in one of the most groundbreaking security reductions in lattice-based cryptography. Here’s a teaser: it connects to the shortest vector problem on the dual lattice. Curious? Stay tuned for the next chapter of this fascinating journey!</p>
