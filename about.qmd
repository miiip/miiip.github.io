Hi there!

My name is Mihail (the guy next to that adorable little girl). I’m a research security engineer. This means I read research papers, publish new ideas and implement various cybersecurity tools. My research focuses on machine learning applications in cybersecurity and privacy. I’m also a Ph.D. student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of the University of Bucharest. My thesis is about applications of Spiking Neural P systems in cybersecurity and especially in cryptography.
